## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(Hmisc)
library(gmodels)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```
## Import data

```{r}
employee <- read_excel("C:/Users/linan/Documents/GitHub/project/R-project/R-project-Employee/Employee Data (1100 Records) f.xlsx",sheet = 1)
```

#Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
# Dimensions of the dataset
dim(employee)
```
```{r}
# Structure of the dataset
str(employee)

# First few rows of the dataset
head(employee)

# Concise summary of the dataset
glimpse(employee)

# Summary statistics
summary(employee)

```


Questions :
1. Does salary level affect the likelihood of an employee leaving?
2. Is there a relationship between years of experience and attrition?
3. Are certain departments more prone to turnover than others?

### Data Cleaning and Exploratory

factors = left_company, department, job_level, businee_travel, job_satisfaction, performance_rating, marital_status
```{r}
library(DataExplorer)
#Change as factors
factor_vars = c("left_company","department","job_level","business_travel","job_satisfaction","performance_rating","marital_status")
num_vars = c("salary","weekly_hours","yrs_At_company","yrs_since_promotion","previouse_companier","miles_from_home")

str(employee)

```

```{r}
employee <- employee %>%
 mutate(left_company = recode(left_company, "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0))
```



```{r}
plot_intro(employee)
```
There's no missing in the data


```{r}
plot_bar(employee)
```

## Does salary level affect the likelihood of an employee leaving?

```{r}
library(s20x)

s20x::summaryStats(salary~left_company, employee)
```

```{r}
shapiro.test(employee$salary)
```
```{r}
hist(employee$salary, main = "histogram of salary")
```
```{r}
plot(employee$salary)
```

```{r}
plot_qq(employee$salary)
```
```{r}
RVAideMemoire::byf.shapiro(salary~left_company,
                             data=employee)
```
```{r}
employee <- tibble(employee)

# Convert the 'left_company' variable to factor if not already
employee$left_company <- as.factor(employee$left_company)

# Perform the numeric summary
RcmdrMisc::numSummary(employee$salary, 
                      groups = employee$left_company)
```
```{r}
library(epiDisplay)
epiDisplay::tab1(employee$left_company, graph=FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(onewaytests)
#Compare the salary between two groups using Mann-Whitney test
onewaytests::mw.test(salary ~ left_company, 
                     data=employee, 
                     alpha=0.05, 
                     na.rm=TRUE, verbose=TRUE)
```
1. Salary variable is not normally distributed, either before and after compared between two groups. 
2. The number of subject who left company 185(16,8%) subjects compared to 915(83,2%).
3. Median of salary in resigned group USD 69.5k(30.5-205.3k) compared to USD 90.7k(30.6-212.2k)
4. Using Mann-Whitney U-test, the group that left the company had lower wage than the group which stay with the company (p<0.05).

## 2. Is there a relationship between years of experience and attrition?

```{r}
str(employee)
```

```{r}
summary(employee$yrs_at_company)
```
```{r}
hist(employee$yrs_at_company)
```
```{r}
plot_qq(employee$yrs_at_company)
```
## 3. Are certain departments more prone to turnover than others?

```{r}
#Provide percentage of factor variable : department
epiDisplay::tab1(employee$department, graph=TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(descr)


x_tab <- CrossTable(employee$department, employee$left_company,
                    prop.c= FALSE, prop.chisq = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE)

x_tab
```
